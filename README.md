# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Tree & Random Forest

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease using machine learning algorithms—**Decision Tree** and **Random Forest Classifier**. The model is trained on a publicly available dataset and demonstrates the use of classification algorithms in medical diagnosis.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms Used

- ✅ Decision Tree Classifier  
- ✅ Random Forest Classifier

These algorithms help in understanding the feature importance and decision-making process involved in classifying whether a person is at risk or not.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
- **Features**: 
  - Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, etc.
  - Target (0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease Present)

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
   - Handling missing/null values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling (if needed)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualizing feature distributions and correlations
3. Model Training
   - Split data into train/test
   - Train Decision Tree & Random Forest
4. Model Evaluation
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix
5. Prediction
   - Make predictions for new patient data

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- ✅ Accuracy Score
- ✅ Confusion Matrix
- ✅ Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- ✅ ROC Curve (optional)

---

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA)
- Scikit-learn (for ML models)

## 🧪 Results

| Model             | Accuracy |
|------------------|----------|
| Decision Tree     | ~70%     |
| Random Forest     | ~78.2%     |
